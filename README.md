# Need For Speed Underground 2 RTX
An RTX-Remix mod for Need For Speed Underground 2. This is attempts to add all the lights that were in the original game and many lights that enhance the original game's world. Includes textures from the community as well!

> **Note**
> 
> Requires a copy of Need For Speed Underground 2 with the latest RTX-Remix release and nightly builds applied.

## Status
> **Warning**
> 
> This doesn't have good performance currently. There are frequently over _100_ lights in view. Feel free to tweak the graphics presets in the rtx menu to gain more perfomance.

- A majority of lights have been added to the world (but need reworked)
- Transitioning to different method of light scale to avoid eye adaption.
  
## Todo
- Vehicles, ~~garages~~, and race locations still need to be done.
- Package textures for distribution.

## Credits
- Countbuggula on discord for his texture work!
