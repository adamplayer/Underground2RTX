# Need For Speed Underground 2 RTX
An RTX-Remix mod for Need For Speed Underground 2. This is attempts to add all the lights that were in the original game and many lights that enhance the original game's world. Will include textures from the community as well in the future!

> **Note**
> 
> Requires a copy of Need For Speed Underground 2 with the latest RTX-Remix release and nightly builds applied.

## Status
> **Warning**
> 
> This doesn't have good performance currently. There are frequently over _100_ lights in view. Feel free to tweak the graphics presets in the rtx menu to gain more perfomance.

- A majority of lights have been added to the world (but need reworked)
- Transitioning to different method of light scale to avoid eye adaption.
- A few locations have been "hand crafted"

### Overview
- [ ] Vehicles
- [x] Garages/Shops
- [ ] Buildings - _In Progress_
- [ ] Race locations
- [ ] Package textures for distribution.
- [x] Reorganize into modular usdas for greater compatibility
- [ ] "Alt" usda overrides for differnt stylization of lighting.

## Installation
Two Options
- With [U2-RTX](https://github.com/Ekozmaster/NFSU2-RTX-Remix)
  -  Take the `rtx-remix/mods/gameReadyAssets` folder from U2-RTX and place it in a new folder called `ExtMod` in the gameReadyAssets' folder: `rtx-remix/mods/gameReadyAssets/ExtMod`
- Standalone:
  - Download this repo and place it in your game install folder.

#### AntiCull Mod _Optional_
_If you use `Anti-Culling Lights` in RTX-Remix and are satisfied with that, do not apply this. This will decrease performance at the cost of removing any culling infront of the player's camera._

**Make sure to make a backup of speed2.exe!** 

Use LunarIPS or [https://bbbradsmith.github.io/ipstool/] to apply the IPS patch to your `speed2.exe`.
